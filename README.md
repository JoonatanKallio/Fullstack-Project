How to run the project:

First install packages by typing `npm run install` in the root folder and it installs client and server packages.

Then go to the server folder and run `npm run dev`

Then open the server folder and run  `npm run start`

To run the cypress tests, type `npm run test` in the parent folder.

The cypress tests can only be run once and then you need to delete post, comment and the user from the database.
